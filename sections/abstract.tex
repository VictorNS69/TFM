In the technology industry, cybersecurity is very important. Companies are increasingly focused on ensuring that their various applications, projects and services are secure; that they are protected from internal and external threats and vulnerabilities.\\

On the other hand, having more and more smart devices connected to the network, mobile applications, web portals and web services provides hackers with a huge playing field, and a very striking scenario for malicious acts. Fortunately, not all hackers are bad: ethical hackers, those who use their skills to improve network security, are increasingly acclaimed by companies.\\

With the aim of introducing me to the world of cybersecurity and hacking, this work was born. As a ``novice`` in the field, I have found many tools and articles to read that allow me to learn and improve my knowledge and skills. One of the most fun and easy (to use) tools I have found is \acrlong{HTB} and the \acrlong{CTF} style events and challenges. These challenges allow you to increase your knowledge in different technologies, such as web, mobile or in certain fields like cryptography or reversing.\\

In this document I will explain the \acrlong{HTB} platform and solve two machines on the platform; I will share the findings and results obtained, as well as the reasons behind the decisions made.\\
